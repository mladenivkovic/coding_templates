/**
 * @struct ParticleIdentifier is used as a key to the 'database' map
 * to keep the particles' history as the map's values.
 *
 * By default, particles' are ID'd by their unique integer ID and
 * type name. However, in certain situations, that may not be enough.
 * For example, if a particle is close to a periodic boundary, it will
 * be replicated and its coordinates shifted appropriately on the other
 * boundary. There will however exist 2 particles with the same unique
 * integer ID and type name, which will cause issues with the assignment
 * checks, as it will have an inappropriate history. Therefore, we also
 * need to take into account the particles' positions to ID them.
 *
 * Luckily, we don't need an exact coordinate match, but we can allow for
 * big tolerances (order of the simulation box size) and thusly sidestep
 * many floating point inaccuracies. This tolerance needs to be specified
 * when constructing a ParticleIdentifier. The recommendation is to use
 * the 'size' of the vertex (`vertexH`) the particle is currently assigned
 * to.
 *
 * A minor complication lies in the fact that a std::map (which is used as
 * the "database") needs strict comparisons. So we define two very similar
 * structs: a ParticleIdentifier, which is used as the key in the map, and
 * a ParticleSearchIdentifier, which is used to search for a particle in
 * the map and permits for a fuzzy search using the tolerance mentioned above.
