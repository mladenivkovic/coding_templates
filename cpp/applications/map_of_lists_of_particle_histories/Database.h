/**
 * @class The Database class stores the actual particle histories.
 * Particles are traced via a map, where the keys are
 * instances of the ParticleIdentifier class. The database itself
 * is implemented as a singleton. To access it, use the getInstance()
 * method.
 *
 * The database will track all events on all spacetrees on this
 * MPI rank. Per particle, we store up to _maxParticleSnapshotsToKeepTrackOf
 * particle events. Once that number is exceeded, the past history will
 * be condensed into a single event, signifying that it had been compacted.

 * Additionally, something we come across very often is that particles,
 * once assigned to a vertex, very often stay assigned to the same
 * vertex for a long time (=many sweeps) and only experiences small movements.
 * Rather than tracing every single move event individually, the database
 * will mark consecutive move events using a special event type,
 * Event::Type::ConsecutiveMoveEvent. It will also keep track the original
 * position of the particle, before the first move event of that sequence
 * has occurred, as well as the current particle position.

   * If the routine encounters a move particle, it changes the

   *
   * ## Implementation
   *
   * I originally thought that I have to release the lock before I
   * jump into the recursion. This is however not necessary, as we
   * are working with read/write locks and I can have an arbitrary
   * number of read locks in this case. Actually, it would be
   * outrightly wrong to free it, as someone might alter the data
   * structure in-between a function and its recursive re-invocation.
   * So we have to keep it lock until we return.
   *
   *
   * @param spacetreeId Either a valid spacetree or AnyTree if you don't
   * care
   *
   * @TODO MLaden: Document parameters.
   *
   * @return tuple of event and identifier. In most cases, the
   *   identifier returned will equal the parameter identifier.
   *   However, if the particle has moved, the result identifier
   *   will identify the spatial position corresponding to the
   *   returned event.
   *
   *   --------------------
   *   Will alloc a new ParticleEvents and add a single
   *   event of type NotFound if there is no history.
   *   Make sure to delete that after you use it.

   * particle position. When we construct the particle identifier
   * for the tail recursion, we have to take into account that the
   * previous position is stored as raw position data, but the
   * database's entries might be slightly off due to truncation
   * errors.
   *
   * If there are multiple moves, we only take the first one into

   *
   * Eventually, it is time to clean up the database. This happens if

   *
   * - If the new event is an assignment, then we know that now

   *   assignment. So we can delete all of this historic data.
   * - If we have tons of particle moves switching vertices (and
   *   hence deleting and re-associating particles), we can eliminate
   *   all of those and instead add two events: one that attaches a
   *   particle and one that moves it in one go.
   *
   * I originally thought that I'd also like to remove old data
   * entries whenever we encounter an erase event. However, this is
   * not necessary: If we have an erase event (for an expired halo
   * element), we'll very likely get a new assignment in a second.
