Notes
----------------------

Front Matter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Front matter tells jekyll to process your file with the Liquid templating language.
It's YAML snippets between 3 dashes at the top of the file:


```
---
# this is front matter
my_name: Hihi hoho
---
<html....>
```


Access via `{{page.my_name}}`.

You can leave it empty if you want no objects defined, but want jekyll to
process your tags strewn throughout the rest of the file.




Layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Store site layouts to be reused in `_layouts`.

Load them up in the front matter:

```
---
layout: default # loads _layouts/default.html
---
```





Includes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include stuff you want to repeat over and over again from `_includes` directory.
