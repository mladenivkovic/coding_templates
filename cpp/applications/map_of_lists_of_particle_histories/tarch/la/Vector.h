/**
 * Simple vector class
 *
 * Most features concerning vectors are deployed into separate headers:
 *
 * - Access only few elements within vector (subvector): VectorSlice.h
 * - Functions over the vector such as norms: VectorOperations.h
 * - Binary operators over vectors: VectorScalarOperations.h and
 *   VectorVectorOperations.h
 *
 * There are multiple ways how to construct a vector:
 *
 * - You can use the standard constructor which gives a vector with garbage
 *   entries. You can then set individual entries manually.
 * - You can use the constructor with a scalar which initialises all entries
 *   with the same value.
 * - You can use initialiser lists, i.e. lists in curly brackets { and }, to
 *   construct a vector from a list.
 *
 * To access entries of a vector, the class provides both access via an
 * array notation, i.e. through [...], and with round brackets. The latter
 * notation resembles Matlab. No matter which accessor you use, enumeration
 * always starts with zero.
 *
 * The class wraps an array of fixed size. Therefore, you can access the raw
 * data via data(), but this violates ideas of object-oriented programming
 * and hence should be done with care. Peano for example does this if and
 * only if it has to hand over raw pointers to MPI, e.g.
 *
 *
 * ## GPGPU offloading
 *
 * ### OpenMP
 *
 * To make the vector operations available on the GPU, they have to be labelled
 * as offloadable according to Section 4.5.2 (page 117) of the standard
 * (https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/openmp-examples-4.5.0.pdf).
 * There, the text highlights that declare target is a declaration thing, i.e.,
 * should not be applied to the definition.
 *
 * However, it is not clear whether the compiler expects the
 * function definition to be within the declaration, too, and if this makes a
 * difference here at all: As the vector is a template, it is header-only
 * anyway. Therefore, the compiler implicitly should have the definition at
 * hand and should be able to identify that code for the GPU has to be
 * generated, too. We only have to be sure that no explicit instantiation of
 * a vector ignores this context, i.e. do not use explicit instantation if you
 * employ GPUs (through OpenMP).
 *
 * With GCC, I struggled using the Vector's copy constructors. That is,
 * my impression is that the GCC compiler struggles to handle templates plus
 * overloading if these are implicitly used within a map clause.
 * Therefore, I often offload code through the standard constructor, deploy
 * the vector components manually, thus avoid all copy constructor
 * invocations explicitly, and finally repuzzle the vector together on the
 * GPU. This implies that GPU routines may never return
 * a Vector instance. See the Rusanov.cpph kernels for examples where this
 * leads to uglier code than necessary. But it works.
 *
 *
 * ## SYCL
 *
 * Our SYCL kernels seem to be fine without explicit support of the vector,
 * but this is mainly due to the fact that SYCL offers its own range class,
 * and we construct our vectors typically from this range class. The other
 * application domain is the double vectors within the cell descriptors,
 * but we map those onto specialsed variants before we offload anyway, so
 * they are on the GPU prior to the kernel launch. In the future, it might
 * be appropriate to add explicit copyable traits to to the class such that
 * they can directly go to the GPU:
