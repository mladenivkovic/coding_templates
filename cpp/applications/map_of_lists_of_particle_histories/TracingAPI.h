/**
 * @namespace toolbox::particles::assignmentchecks Correctness checks of
 * particle-mesh assignment
 *
 * This API is inspired by SWIFT's swift2::dependencychecks as introduced
 * by Mladen: We keep some history of particle-mesh associations, trace new
 * mesh assignments and validate them against the recorded history. All the
 * tracing degenerates to empty routines if we work in release mode, so
 * there should not be any overhead.
 *
 * Most toolbox routines do automatically report against this API. However,
 * to make the checks work, you have to report particle movements manually.
 *
 * Furthermore, you might want to invoke
 * toolbox::particles::assignmentchecks::startMeshSweep() prior to your
 * traversals to ensure that you get a nice break-down of all mesh
 * transitions.
 *
 * ## Enable assignment checks
 *
 * By default, the assignment checks are enabled as soon as PeanoDebug is
 * set to a value greater than 0. However, you can explicitly disable it
 * by adding
 *
 * -DnoAssignmentChecks
 *
 * to your compile flags. This is important as assignment checks are very
 * expensive. The checks also might yield invalid errors once you run them
 * over multiple ranks, i.e with -DParallel.

/**
 * Assign a particle to a vertex
 *
 * Take the particle, perform some consistency checks, and then add the
 * particle event to our history database. The consistency checks differ
 * for local from virtual particles.
 *
 * ## Consistency checks
 *
 * ### Consistency checks for local particles
 *
 * - A new particle might have been inserted into the domain for the very
 *   first time. In this case, the particle has to be "free", i.e. it may
 *   not have been assigned to any other vertex yet. The search should
 *   reduce a NotFound.
 * - The particle might have been dropped from a coarser level. See
 *   corresponding discussion for virtual particles below including some
 *   sketches.
 * - The particle might have been lifted. Lifting can only occur for
 *   local particles, as it is a result of a move and we may only move
 *   local particles. If the assignment is due to a lift, this local
 *   particle has been assigned to a finer mesh resolution before.
 * - If we lift a particle into the global sieve set (as the particle
 *   tunnels or there's a horizontal cut through the spacetree, i.e. the
 *   coarser cell is held by another rank), we will sieve the particle
 *   into the local domain in the next step. In this case, the previous
 *   particle's state could be local or virtual: If the particle has moved
 *   and therefore ended up in the sieve set, we will not have updated
 *   its parallel flag yet. Therefore, it might have changed.
 * - A particle might change from remote to local. This can only happen
 *   in UpdateParallelState after a merge, which first detaches a particle
 *   and then readds it with the local flag set.
 *
 *
 * ### Consistency check for virtual particles
 *
 * - The particle comes in through the boundary as part of the boundary
 *   exchange. In this case, the particle has to be "free", i.e. it may
 *   not be assigned to any other vertex yet. The particle has to be new
 *   (NotFound in database).
 * - If it is an update of the halo copy, we would expect the
 *   corresponding merge() to replace this copy. A replacement manifests
 *   in an event sequence of detach->erase->assign, so we still get a
 *   NotFound throughout the assign.
 * - A virtual particle might also be subject of a mesh drop: If we lift
 *   a particle, exchange it along the boundary, we have to drop it on
 *   both sides again. We update its state
 *   ***after*** we have assigned it to a vertex, but we also set its
 *   state in the merge, so here the state has to be virtual.
 * - A local particle might have changed from local to virtual as it
 *   had moved. In this case, the update should detach the particle
 *   before it adds it again.
 * - We might drop due to a global sieve. In this case, the previous
 *   particle's state could be local or virtual: If the particle has moved
 *   and therefore ended up in the sieve set, we will not have updated
 *   its parallel flag yet. Therefore, it might have changed.
 *
 * In the scenario below, we illustrate the last scenario by means of an
 * interface between two ranks. It
 * is denoted below as grey partition (one left rank) and a blueish
 * partition (on the right rank). They have kind of a halo layer of
 * width one, which is a logical construct, i.e. not maintained manually.
 *
 * @image html scenario00_particle-through-domain-wall.png
 *
 * Study the central setup: In step N, yellow moves, while red will be
 * deleted after the traversal, as each step moving particles has to
 * update states as well (UpdateParallelState action set). Yellow now
 * might be lifted to the next level. So far, its state is local on the
 * grey rank, no matter if it stays within this subdomain or not. We
 * exchange the data after step N.
 *
 * In step N+1, either rank sets the state to local or virtual. This
 * happens either in touchVertexFirstTime() in the UpdateParallelState
 * action set, or it happens straight in merge(). No matter what, it
 * happens on the coarser level before we even touch the fine mesh
 * level. When we drop it, the particle has the correct parallel state.
 *
 *
 * Another special situation arises from a setup, where the particle of
 * interest is located exactly along the subdomain boundary. In this
 * case, we move both copies, as the particle is considered to be local
 * on both ranks. Let one rank (tree 0) subsequently lift the particle,
 * as it has moved quite a bit. The other rank (tree 1) therefore also
 * has to lift yet cannot do so, as the next coarser mesh level is
 * actually owned by tree 0. It adds its particle to the sieve set.
 * After the movement, the particle is on the coarser level on tree 0
 * and in the sieve set of tree 1.
 *
 * This sieve set is now exchanged between the trees. Tree 1 seems to be
 * kind of simple: The particle will be taken from the sieve set,
 * inserted into the domain (given that it hasn't totally left this
 * tree) and will then either be set to local or virtual. However, we
 * will also get a copy of this particle from tree 0 through the
 * boundary. This copy will then be sieved. We end up with two copies:
 * One from the global sieve set and one from the boundary.
 *
 * Tree 0's behaviour exhibits the same behaviour: We will drop the
 * particle which we have temporarily lifted to the next coarser level.
 * After we have dropped it, we will also insert the copy from the
 * global sieve set.
 *
 * @param particleIsNew If we know that a particle is new, there's no
 *                      need to search through the database.
 * @param reassignmentOnSameTreeDepthAllowed If true, assume our
 *                      particle sorting/bookkeeping algorithm allows
 *                      for a particle to be reassigned from one vertex
 *                      to another vertex on the same depth in the tree
 *                      directly (through its movement). Otherwise,
 *                      expect the particle to be sorted either via
 *                      sieves, lifts, or drops.
