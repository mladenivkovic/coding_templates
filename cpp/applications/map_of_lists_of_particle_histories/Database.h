           * are working with read/write locks and I can have an arbitrary
           * number of read locks in this case. Actually, it would be
           * outrightly wrong to free it, as someone might alter the data
           * structure in-between a function and its recursive re-invocation.
           * So we have to keep it lock until we return.

           *   However, if the particle has moved, the result identifier
           *   will identify the spatial position corresponding to the
           *   returned event.
